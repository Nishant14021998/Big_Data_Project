## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to find the top 5 hashtag trends for different months. The results are formatted as follows:
- Month
- Rank
- Hashtag
- Number of tweets

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes tweet data with hashtags and timestamps. The dataset is pre-processed and analyzed using Spark.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and analysis.
- **Databricks**: For running and managing Spark sessions.

## Notebooks

The analysis is documented in the following Jupyter Notebook:

- `BDE_MidTerm_Group10.ipynb`: Contains the code for setting up the Spark session, processing the data, and generating the results for hashtag trends.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, you need to have the following setup:

1. **Apache Spark**: Install Spark from [here](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
3. **Databricks**: You can use Databricks for a managed Spark environment. Sign up [here](https://databricks.com/).

### Steps to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook BDE_MidTerm_Group10.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the Spark session and run the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analysis include the top 5 hashtags for each month, along with their ranks and the number of tweets. These results can be used to understand the popularity and trends of different hashtags over time.
